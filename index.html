        <h3>[Verse 1]</h3>
        <p>
            Conversion, software version 7.0
            Looking at life through the eyes of a tire hub
            Eating seeds as a pastime activity
            The toxicity of our city, of our city
        </p>

        <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
        <p>
            You, what do you own the world? How do you own disorder, disorder?
            Now, somewhere between the sacred silence, sacred silence and sleep
            Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep
            Disorder, disorder, disorder
        </p>
        

        <h3>[Verse 2]</h3>
        <p>
            More wood for their fires, loud neighbors
            Flashlight reveries caught in the headlights of a truck
            Eating seeds as a pastime activity
            The toxicity of our city, of our city
        </p>

        <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
        <p>
            You, what do you own the world? How do you own disorder, disorder?
            Now, somewhere between the sacred silence, sacred silence and sleep
            Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep
            Disorder, disorder, disorder
        </p>
        <h3>[Instrumental Bridge]</h3>

        <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
        <p>
            You, what do you own the world? How do you own disorder?
            Now, somewhere between the sacred silence, sacred silence and sleep
            Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep
            Disorder, disorder, disorder
        </p>
        

        <h3>[Outro]</h3>
        <p>
            When I became the sun, I shone life into the man's hearts
            When I became the sun, I shone life into the man's hearts
        </p>
